# üìì Brief Introduction to Capundi

*Capundi is an app that can simulate a cup of coffee.* But coffee is supposed to be drinkable, you thought. And you will be 100% right!

So what's up with this virtual drink thingy? What's the point of undrinkable coffee? 

You see, life is hard. I think we can all agree on this, don't we? But as the French said, *c'est la vie,* it's life. I learned through numerous trials and errors that life is ultimately what you make out of it, and my little anchor or happiness in life happens to be a cup of coffee that I brew every single morning to start my day. 

I want to show people what my little happiness looks like and how it makes me feel. So I came up with a simple visualization of what I experienced that will induce a similar feeling and, if you must, *vibe*.

The app can simulate a cup of coffee. You can interact with it (stir the coffee, tap the coffee cup, lift the spoon, etc) and depending on each interaction, you will hear a ASMR-like sounds. 

# ‚úíÔ∏è Etymology

The word 'capundi' (pronounced: *kah-poon-dee*) is a combination of two latin words: *capulus* (coffee) and *mundi* (world). Quite cheesy to pick latin as the app's name, but I ended up liking the name a lot. It's catchy and endearing enough for me. 

# üé® Design Process

Designing Capundi has been a challenging process for me. I think with regular app, there's bound to be a certain hierarchy already set up in mind and there's going to be a compartmentalization of features that will translate well into pages of app interface. But with a simple simulation app such as Capundi, the pages isn't the problem. It's trying to somehow translate the animation and interaction that I had in mind into a static picture. Doing this project individually, the mental picture is enough. But the elephant in the room persists: *What happens if I worked in a group? How should I communicate the designs for the technical team?* There must be a particular technique to make a gaming prototype, but I haven't found out about it yet.

If the design prototype looks lacking, it's because I'm not sure how I should portray the complexity of movements into simple 2D images.

## Visual Research

I was leaning more into something similar to the aesthetics that I enjoy until I realized: I'm already living in my dream aesthetic. So I just took a photo of my table and my usual coffee cup (right most picture) and extracted the color.

My inspiration on how I would like the simulation to look like came from popular ASMR animation/visualizer. Here's some of my favorite examples if you're interested:

## Wireframe

## High Fidelity Prototype

I went straight from wireframe into hifi prototype because I think the wireframe is clear enough to construct a hifi. Most of the designing processes were spent on creating the assets.

## Assets

All of the assets were made by myself. Well, that sounds as if I was a some sort of design genius, but if you haven't noticed already most of the designs are just photos :D

### Visual Assets

For the visual assets, I just took photos of my personal property. Here's the list of items:

1. The cup
2. The coffee (and a bunch of its movement to create a stop motion animation)
3. The golden spoon
4. The background

### Sound Assets

Yes, the sound assets were also recorded by yours truly. Here's the list of sounds I use:

1. Cup tapping sound
2. Stirring sound
3. Putting spoon down sound
